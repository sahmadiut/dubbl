# DATA-003 — Add reusable saved views and bulk operations

## Objective and implementation scope

Add missing saved filters/sorts/columns and justified bulk operations using current architecture. Validate fields and authorization; document private/shared scope.

## Inputs

- Requirements: [Markdown implementation plan](../sources/SOURCE.md), sections [`bigcapital-to-dubbl-feature-map`](../sources/SOURCE.md#bigcapital-to-dubbl-feature-map), [`security-and-privacy`](../sources/SOURCE.md#security-and-privacy), [`performance`](../sources/SOURCE.md#performance). See [coverage map](../sources/PLAN_COVERAGE.md).
- Actual fork source and tests, docs/REPOSITORY_MAP.md, and relevant registries.
- Dependency task evidence; plan assertions alone do not prove implementation.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] View definitions are versioned and cannot inject arbitrary queries.
- [ ] Cross-organization view access fails.
- [ ] Bulk actions apply domain validation, locks and idempotency.

## Verification

Run the repository's discovered commands for the affected behavior. Add meaningful regression/negative tests for financial, migration, authorization or compatibility changes. For an audit/documentation task, verify source links and reproduce claimed commands. Record exact command, exit result, fixture/context, observed outcome and limitations in a task-specific evidence Markdown file. Never report an unrun check as passed.

## Handoff

Not started. First inspect the actual fork; replace this with changed files, completed steps, remaining work, blockers and the exact next action before ending a session.

## History

- Initial backlog generated from the supplied plan. Implementation status is unverified; no task is marked complete.
