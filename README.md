## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- PostgreSQL 15+ (or use Docker)
- S3-compatible storage (optional, for file uploads)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dubbl-org/dubbl.git
cd dubbl

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your configuration:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dubbl

# Auth
AUTH_SECRET=your-random-secret-here
AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Stripe (optional)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Trigger.dev background jobs (required for production scheduled tasks/retries)
TRIGGER_PROJECT_REF=proj_...
TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY=tr_dev_...

# S3 Storage (optional)
S3_BUCKET=dubbl-uploads
S3_REGION=us-east-1
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
S3_ENDPOINT=https://s3.amazonaws.com
```

### Database Setup

```bash
# Push schema to database
pnpm db:push

# Seed with demo data (optional)
pnpm db:seed
```

### Run

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

If you ran the seed script, log in with `demo@dubbl.dev` / `password123`.

### Background Jobs

Dubbl uses Trigger.dev for scheduled maintenance and delayed retries. For production, set `TRIGGER_PROJECT_REF` and `TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY`, then deploy the tasks:

```bash
pnpm trigger:deploy
```

Without Trigger.dev, scheduled backups, bookkeeping maintenance, invoicing maintenance, trash purge, report schedules, notification digests, Stripe retries, and webhook delivery retries will not run automatically. Webhook retries are scheduled when a delivery fails, so keep `TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY` configured in the app runtime before accepting webhook traffic.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework** - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) (App Router)
- **Database** - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) with [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team)
- **Auth** - [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)
- **UI** - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) + [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)
- **Docs** - [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.vercel.app)

## Development Checks

Use the pnpm version declared in `package.json` and the committed `pnpm-lock.yaml`:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test
```

PostgreSQL migration integration tests run separately with an explicit local test-server connection and a role with `CREATEDB` permission:

```bash
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://test_user:test_password@localhost:5432/test_database pnpm test:integration
```

The suite creates and removes randomly named test databases; it does not migrate or reset the connection's existing database. See the [CI runbook](.agentic/docs/CI_RUNBOOK.md) for Windows commands, fixture coverage and known qualification gaps.

GitHub Actions tests migrations against a temporary PostgreSQL database. Applying migrations to a deployment database is disabled by default. Enable the `Apply Migrations` job only for an authorized deployment by setting the repository variable `AUTO_MIGRATE` to `true` and configuring the `DATABASE_URL` repository secret for that target. Leave `AUTO_MIGRATE` unset or `false` during local development. Local `.env` files are not uploaded to CI.

## Self-Hosting

See the [Self-Hosting Guide](https://dubbl.dev/docs/self-hosting) for instructions on deploying dubbl with Docker.

## MCP Server

dubbl includes a built-in [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that lets any MCP-compatible AI agent interact with your accounting data. The MCP server uses Streamable HTTP transport with OAuth 2.1 authentication and is available on all plans.

Works with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code Copilot, and any other MCP-enabled agent. Just point your client at:

```
https://dubbl.dev/api/mcp
```

See the [MCP documentation](https://dubbl.dev/docs/guides/mcp) for setup instructions for each client.

## Documentation

Full documentation is available at [dubbl.dev/docs](https://dubbl.dev/docs) or by running the app locally and visiting `/docs`.
