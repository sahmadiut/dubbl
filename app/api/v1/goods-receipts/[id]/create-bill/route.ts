/**
 * Create a draft bill from a goods receipt (GRN).
 *
 * Reads the GRN, its lines and its linked purchase order, then creates a DRAFT
 * bill for the same supplier with one bill line per received GRN line:
 *   - description / inventoryItem / warehouse mirror the GRN line
 *   - quantity = quantityReceived (x100, document scale)
 *   - unitPrice = the GRN line's recorded unit cost (PO unit cost at receipt)
 *   - goodsReceiptLineId links the bill line to the GRN line so that, when the
 *     bill is later received/approved, the existing GRNI/PPV three-way-match
 *     logic (see lib/api/bill-lifecycle.ts) clears the GRNI accrual that
 *     was posted at receipt time and stamps the GRN as billed.
 *
 * We intentionally do NOT post any journal entry here: the bill is a draft, and
 * GRNI clearing happens at bill posting (receive/approve) exactly as for a bill
 * created the normal way. All amounts are integer minor units; quantities x100.
