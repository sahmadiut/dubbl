 * Ensure a bank account is connected to a ledger (GL) account, creating/linking
 * one on demand, and return that ledger account's id.
 *
 * Every bank movement we post (categorising, creating an expense, matching a
 * transfer, reconciling) must debit/credit a balance-sheet account so the books
 * stay in balance. Rather than make the user set this up, we connect it for them:
 *
 *  1. Reuse the standard account for this type (e.g. 1100 Checking) when it
 *     already exists and isn't tied to another bank account — so a typical
 *     one-account business keeps a clean, standard chart with no extra accounts.
 *  2. Otherwise allocate an additional account in the right band, named after
 *     the bank account so it's identifiable. This only happens when the standard
 *     slot is already taken (e.g. a second checking account), which keeps the
 *     one-ledger-account-per-bank-account rule that lets each reconcile on its own.
 *
 * The account is marked `isSystem` so the control account can't be deleted or
 * retyped out from under the feed. No-op when already linked. Pass the
 * surrounding `exec` when calling inside a db.transaction so the new account
 * commits/rolls back with the caller's writes.
